/*
Write a function that reverses a singly linked list in place.

It must be declared as follows:

t_list  *reverse_list(t_list *lst);

- lst: a pointer to the beginning of a singly linked list.
- The function should reverse the order of the nodes in the list.
- It must return a pointer to the new head of the reversed list.

You must use the following structure, and turn it in your file reverse_list.c:

typedef struct    s_list
{
    int           value;
    struct s_list *next;
}                 t_list;

You are not allowed to use any functions other than malloc and free.
