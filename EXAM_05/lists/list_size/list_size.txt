/*
Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list.

It must be declared as follows:

int     ft_list_size(t_list *begin_list);

- begin_list: a pointer to the beginning of the list.
- The function should return the number of nodes in the list.

You must use the following structure, and turn it in your file ft_list_size.c:

typedef struct    s_list
{
    struct s_list *next;
    void          *data;
}                 t_list;

You may assume the list is properly terminated (last nodeâ€™s next is NULL).
*/
